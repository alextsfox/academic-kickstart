# Writing PyOCN
I recently took a shot at building an actual software library, something I haven't really done before. I've made loads of scripts and one-off software projects for my own use or for research use, but never something meant to be distributed to the public. It turned into a substantial learning experience for me. I had to sharpen my C programming skills, learn how foreign function interfaces work, understand how software libraries are structured, and figure out how to distribute a Python package publicly.

The result of my work is `PyOCN`: a collection of tools for working with Optimal Channel Networks (OCNs) inspired by the `OCNet` R package developed in Carraro et al. (2020), *Generation and application of river network analogues for use in ecology and evolution. Ecology and Evolution.* doi:10.1002/ece3.6479. It mirrors some of the functionality of the OCNet R package (https://lucarraro.github.io/OCNet/), but implemented in python and C, and with some substantial performance improvements.

I first used OCNs in 2024 during a project as an intern at Oak Ridge National Lab. I liked the elegance of the algorithm but found the OCNet R package limiting: many hydroligists prefer to work in python over R, and the OCNet R package had some substantial performance and dependency issues. I tried rewriting the algorithm in Python, but it was painfully slow: roughly 30 minutes to generate a 64×64 grid that OCNet handles in seconds. Digging through OCNet revealed that it relies heavily on SPArse Matrix (SPAM), a Fortran library, so my pure-Python rewrite was doomed. I tried again in Julia, still without the performance I wanted. Eventually I shelved the project. A few months later, while procrastinating on my PhD thesis, I decided to give it one more shot, this time implementing the entire backend in C and wrapping it with Python bindings.

# OCN basics
OCNs are models of river network structure based on the principle of optimality: river networks evolve to minimize the total energy expenditure of transporting water through the network. A stream with high erosional power will meet resistance from the landscape as it incises its channel. In the case of OCNs, erosional power of a single segment $i$ of a river network is assumed to depend on (1) mean discharge ($Q_i$) and (2) channel slope ($s_i$). Both mean discharge and channel slope are assumed to depend on drained area ($A_i$):

$$
E_i \propto Q_i s_i \propto A_i^\gamma \\
$$

The energy dissipated by the entire network is then:

$$
E = \sum_i A_i^\gamma,
$$

OCNs are generated by minimizing this total energy. The parameter $\gamma$ relates to how slope (and therefore energy dissapation) scales with drained area. In networks with $\gamma \approx 0$, small watersheds are the steepest, and dominate the energy budget: the optimal OCN will be dominated by large watersheds. In networks with $\gamma \approx 1$, all watersheds are equally steep, and energy is dissapated evenly across the network: the optimal OCN could have a wide variety of watershed sizes.

To illustrate this, consider the elevation map of the following two OCNs, optimized with $\gamma = 0.2$ (left) and $\gamma = 0.8$ (right). The unique streams in the low-$\gamma$ network are far more tortuous, fewer in number, there are very few headwater catchments, and the elevation provile is very flat (never exceeding 4 m in elevation). In contrast, the high-$\gamma$ network has many short, straight streams, a large number of small headwater catchments, and grows to almost 50 m in elevation.

The algorithm for generating and OCN is fairly straightforward:

1. Initialize a spanning-tree network on a 2D grid. Each cell drains into one of its 8 neighbors (except the root, which has not outlet).
2. Randomly propose changing a cell’s outflow to a different neighbor while maintaining a spanning tree (no cycles, no multi-outflow nodes) without any crossed edges.
3. Randomly accept or reject the proposal weighted by how strongly it changes the network's energy. This is done using a simulated annealing approach, where the probability of accepting a proposed change is given by:

$$
P(\mathrm{accept}) = \min\left(1, \exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{proposed} - E_\mathrm{current}}{T}\right)\right),
$$

where $E$ is the network energy and $T$ is the temperature. Note that a change is always accepted if it lowers the networks energy. An annealing schedule is freely chosen, and controls how $T$ decays over time, typically given as an exponential decay.

The algorithm runs until convergence ($\Delta E / E < \varepsilon$) or a fixed number of iterations is reached. Temperature starts high and decays, allowing the network to first explore a range of possible states before settling into a low-energy structure.

Finally, a DEM can be generated from the OCN by assigning slopes to each edge in the network based on the following equation:

Below is an example of optimizing an OCN with $\gamma = 0.375$. Blue/green colors indicate low elevation, and brown/white colors indicate high elevation. Since this OCN was optimized with a periodic boundary condition, the boundary of the watershed can change over time as flowpaths "jump" across the the boundary. I think it's quite beautiful, like an amoeba squirming around under a microscope.

OCNs make for a good first C project: the algorithm is conceptually straightforward but requires careful handling of a nontrivial data structure (a spanning tree over a fixed grid with 0 crossed edges). And because it’s not vectorizable, I can't just shove my code into a bunch of NumPy arrays and expect a significant speed-up.

More information on OCNs and network scaling dynamics can be found in:

# Algorithm implementation
The most popular existing implementation of the OCN algorithm is the `OCNet` R package developed by Carraro et al. (2020). This implementation uses a matrix representation of the flow network. The implementation is rather elegant, but I found it difficult to follow at first. 

Therefore I'll talk about my implementation (in `PyOCN`) of the OCN algorithm, and then I'll compare it to the `OCNet` approach. In `PyOCN`, I represent the flow network directly as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), represented in code as an array of nodes with attributes indicating which neighbors they connect to and drain towards. Rerouting a cell's outflow (step 2 of the algorithm) involves pointing a nodes outflow to a different neighbor (and updating the old and new neighbors' inflow edges accordingly). This change may introduce cycles in the graph, which are invalid in a river network. To check for cycles, `PyOCN` follows the downstream path from both the new and old downstream neighbors of the target node. If it ever encounters a single node twice, it knows that a cycle was created, and it goes back to step 1 (after undoing the re-route). The re-route changes the drained areas of all cells downstream of the source cell, which must be updated to reflect the new flow path. The energy of the modified network can then be computed by determining how the change in drained areas affects the total energy, and the proposal can be accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion (step 3 of the algorithm).

The implementation in `OCNet` is quite different, relying on sparse matrix operations to represent and manipulate the flow network. In `OCNet`, the flow network is represented as a sparse adjacency matrix $\mathbf{W}$, where each entry $\mathbf{W}_{ij}$ indicates whether cell $i$ drains into cell $j$. Rerouting a cell's outflow involves updating the adjacency matrix to reflect the new connection (and the loss of the old connection). The modified adjacency matrix is then checked for validity by performing an incremental topological sort to detect cycles. A topological sort is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph such that for every directed edge from node $i$ to node $j$, $i$ comes before $j$ in the ordering. If a cycle exists in the graph, then the sort will fail, and the re-route will have to be un-done. The topological sort also comes in handy for computing drained areas efficiently using an identity of the adjacency matrix: $(\mathbb{I} - \mathbf{W}^T)\vec A = \vec 1,$ where $\vec A$ is the vector of drained areas, and $\vec 1$ is a vector of ones. This linear system can be solved for $\vec A$ to yield the drained areas for all cells. This linear system can be done very efficiently (in $O(n)$ time) if $\mathbf{W}$ is upper triangular. Luckily, the topological sort that was done to verify the integrity of the graph provides a permutation of the nodes $\mathbf{P}$ such that the permuated adjacency matrix $\mathbf{PWP}^T$ is upper triangular. Finally, the energy of the modified network can be computed using the updated drained areas, and the proposal can be accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion (step 3 of the algorithm).

Here's a diagram comparing the structure of the two approaches. On the left is the DAG approach used in `PyOCN`, and on the right is the adjacency matrix approach used in `OCNet`.

This diagram roughly shows how the two implementation differ.

To me, the implementation of `PyOCN` is simpler to approach, but it does require more bookkeeping and code to handle traversing the graph and updating drained areas. The `OCNet` approach is more elegant, but it took me a while to understand how the various pieces fit together. Regardless, both implementations yield identical results, and the optimization time should scale roughly linearly with the number of cells in the grid.

# libocn
`OCNet` splits the implementation of the OCN algorithm between R and Fortran: R handles the high-level logic and user interface, while Fortran handles the computationally intensive sparse matrix manipulations. In `PyOCN`, I decided to implement everything except for the user interface in C, which I compiled into a shared library, `libocn`, that could be called from Python.

In `libocn`, I represent the flow network as a custom data structure built around a flat array of `Vertex` structs. Each `Vertex` struct represents a single cell in the grid, and contains fields for the drained area, outflow direction, and a bitmask indicating which of its 8 neighbors it has edges to:

```c
typedef struct {
    double area;    // Cumulative drained area
    char outflow;   // Direction of outflow (0-7)
    char edges;     // Bitmask of connected neighbors
} Vertex;
```

The bitmask encodes which of the 8 neighbors have edges. For example, a cell with edges in the cardinal directions N, SE, and SW has mask `00101001` (where bit 0 is N, 3 is SE, and 5 is SW):

A `FlowGrid` is stores an array of `Vertex` structs, along with metadata:

```c
typedef struct {
    int nrows;
    int ncols;
    Vertex *grid;
    double total_energy;
} FlowGrid;
```

The `*grid` field is a pointer to an array of `Vertex` structs, stored as a 1d array in row-major order of shape `(nrows * ncols)`. I experimented with block-tiling instead of row-major ordering to improve cache locality, but the indexing overhead seemed to outweigh the benefits, and added complexity.

# PyOCN
I compiled the backend into a shared library, `libocn.so`, and interfaced with it using Python’s `ctypes` library to create the `PyOCN` package. Apparently, I could have actually built `libocn` as a native Python extension module using the `PyModule` C API, which would have allowed for tighter integration with Python. However, that approach requires a lot more boilerplate code to handle converting between Python objects and C structs than I was willing to write for this small project, and likely limits the compatability of `libocn` with languages other than Python. Instead, `ctypes` let me redefine the C header files in Python so it could navigate `libocn` as a foreign library, and then I just built Python functions and classes that wrapped the raw C functions in a user-friendly interface.

The Python side centers on the `OCN` class, which wraps a `FlowGrid` structure and its associated optimization functions, in addition to providing constructors, customizable optimization routines, and various export, visualization, and analysis utilities. In PyOCN, you can create and optimize an OCN in just a few lines of code:

```python
import PyOCN as po
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Create an OCN on a 64x64 grid with gamma=0.5, with a periodic boundary condition and "hip-roof" initial structure
ocn = po.OCN.from_net_type("H", dims=(64, 64), gamma=0.5, wrap=True, random_state=8472)
# optimize the OCN
ocn.fit()
# Visualize the resulting DEM
res = ocn.to_xarray()
res.elevation.plot(cmap="terrain")
plt.show()
```

# Performance comparison

Both of these operations (the DAG approach and the adjacency matrix approach) should have time complexity $O(N)$ in the worst case, where $N$ is the number of cells in the grid. I can't directly compare performance between the two different algorithms since `OCNet` is implemented in R and Fortran, while `PyOCN` is implemented in Python and C. Additionally, `OCNet` only delegates out the most basic backend stuff (like performing the raw sparse matrix operations) to Fortran, whereas `PyOCN` does everything except for the interface in `C`. However, in my tests, my `PyOCN` is much faster than `OCNet`. Whether is because my algorithm is faster or just because R is relatively slow is impossible to say. On an M1 Macbook Pro, `PyOCN` is consistently about ~20-60x faster than `OCNet`. They both seem to scale roughly as $O(N)$ in practice, which aligns with my rough complexity computation.

# Building and distributing
Distributing a Python package with a C backend is not trivial. I had to learn the Python build chain, including how to get `setup.py` to compile the C code automatically. I didn’t want to distribute wheels (a pre-compiled binary Python package) for every platform, and I didn’t want users compiling the code manually, so the `setup.py` route made the most sense.

You can now install `PyOCN` from PyPI with `pip install PyOCN`.

The source code is on GitHub: https://github.com/alextsfox/PyOCN

Documentation is here: https://pyocn.readthedocs.io

# Future Work
Currently, `PyOCN` implements the DAG version of the OCN algorithm. I would like to try implementing the adjacency matrix version as well, to compare performance and code complexity. Right now, `PyOCN` also has some basic export, visualization, and analysis tools: you can export the OCN as a raster DEM or as a graph in `networkx`, but I would like to see some more advanced analysis tools added: stream order calculations, hydrologic unit delineation, and watershed extraction are high on my list.

# Wrapping up
This project was a huge success for me: I learned a lot about C programming, Python packaging, and software design, and I created an alternative implementation of the OCN algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than the existing library.

`PyOCN` is still a hobby project. If you need well-tested academic software, `OCNet` is likely the more stable choice. But if you want a fast, Python-native way to play with OCNs and simulated river networks, `PyOCN` does the job well (and with love).

If you end up using it for something, I’d genuinely like to hear about it.

Thanks for reading!
