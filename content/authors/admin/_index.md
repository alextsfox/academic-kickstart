My work focuses on providing tools, data pipelines, and field instrumentation to study how landscape processes like energy and water cycles respond to environmental change. My current research at the University of Wyoming focuses on hydrologic modeling, soil-plant-atmosphere interactions, disturbance recovery in snow-dominated ecosystems, and developing pipelines for micrometeorological data processing. I also manage sensor networks to support long-term, high-resolution ecosystem monitoring efforts.
